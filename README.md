### Further Research -2 

Where is GIT located and what does it do internally?

#### Git On Your Computer

#### Git-Internals
I have often contemplated how to fix this if the system fails?! So i looked up and found something know as Git Internals.

  <summary><h2> RECIPES </h2></summary>

### Recipe: Make Local Repository
    STEPS TO MAKE A LOCAL REPOSITORY
    - Step 0. Open Git Bash in that particular folder. 
    - Step 1. Type git init (this will make that folder a repository)
    - Step 2. Type git add . (this will add all files to the repository)
    - Step 3. Type git commit -m ‚ÄúInitial commit msg‚Äù (all files now in the repository)
    - Step 4. Type git status (you will get a msg, ‚ÄúOn branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean‚Äù this shows your local repository is finally created)
### Recipe: Push Local Repository to GitHub online
    STEPS TO PUSH A LOCAL REPOSITORY TO A GITHUB REPOSITORY ONLINE
    - Step 0. Open your GitHub profile and create a New Repository. 
    - Step 1. Copy the SSH Key of that created repository.
    - Step 2. Open Git Bash in that particular folder that you want to push. Type git remote add origin PASTE_SSH_KEY_OF_CREATED_REPO. Then type git push origin master ‚Äìforce (type ‚Äòmain‚Äô in place of the ‚Äòmaster‚Äô if your default branch is master)
    - Step 3. Now, refresh your Github page, you will be able to see your committed folders/files there.
